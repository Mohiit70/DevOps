# What is Shell script 

Shell scripting is the process of writing scripts or programs using a shell, which is a command-line interpreter for Unix-like operating systems. These scripts contain a series of commands that are executed sequentially by the shell, automating tasks and operations within the system.


# Important Command Line

ls: Lists files and directories in the current directory.

pwd: Prints the present working directory (current directory).

mkdir [directory_name]: Creates a new directory.

touch [file_name]: Creates a new empty file.

vi or vim: Text editors for creating and editing files.

history: Displays a list of previously executed commands.

free: Displays information about system memory usage.

top: Interactive process viewer for monitoring system resource usage.

nproc: Prints the number of processing units available.

df: Displays disk space usage information for filesystems.

echo: To print something ie. 'Hello World'


# Role of Shell Scripting in DevOps

Shell scripting plays a vital role in DevOps, especially in managing large-scale Linux virtual machine (VM) environments like the one maintained by John in Amazon. Here's why:

1. **Automation**: Shell scripting enables the automation of repetitive tasks such as provisioning, configuring, and maintaining VMs. This helps streamline processes and reduce manual effort.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Shell scripts can be used to define infrastructure configurations as code, making it easier to manage and reproduce infrastructure changes across different environments. This promotes consistency and reliability.

3. **Task Orchestration**: Shell scripts are effective for orchestrating complex tasks involving multiple steps or systems. In the context of VM management, shell scripts can handle tasks like scaling, deployment, and monitoring, simplifying operations.

4. **Customization and Flexibility**: Shell scripting provides the flexibility to customize configurations and processes according to specific requirements. DevOps engineers can tailor solutions to their organization's needs, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness.
