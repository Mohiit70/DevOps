# Virtual Machine ?

1 Arc, 1 House: In this scenario, there is one house built on one acre of land. This setup may be considered inefficient in terms of land usage because only one house is utilizing the entire acre of land.

1 Arc, 2 Houses: In this scenario, there are two houses built on one acre of land. This configuration is generally more efficient compared to the previous case because it maximizes the use of the land by accommodating two houses instead of just one. This approach is often preferred as it optimizes land utilization and potentially increases housing density without significantly impacting the available space.

In summary, having two houses on one acre of land is usually considered a more efficient use of space compared to having just one house on the same amount of land.

DevOps
example.com gets 5 servers from Civo:

s1: Team 1
s2: Team 2
s3: Team 3
s4: Team 4
s5: Team 5

HP IBM 1 server: We install hypervisor (vm1 + vm2 + vm3). VMware, Xen provide logical separation/virtualization. They work as VMs with their own storage, RAM, etc. No one depends on each other.

Example: Amazon has servers in Mumbai. They create a physical server, put it in a data center. In AWS, we use EC2 VM. It goes to a physical server, and the hypervisor provides one VM to us.

Q: What is latency?

Less latency is good, i.e., Mumbai compared to others.

AWS, from my AWS account: Manual or automation. I book 10 GB and 12 CPUs. AWS sends it to hyperservices then gives key value.

End goal: Improve efficiency.
