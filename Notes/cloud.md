# What is cloud computing ?

Cloud computing involves utilizing remotely located servers for accessing and managing data and applications. There are four primary types of cloud deployments:

1. **Private Cloud:** Reserved for a single organization, offering enhanced security and control over data.

2. **Public Cloud:** Accessible to the general public, hosted by third-party providers. It is a cost-effective option with scalability benefits.

3. **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This provides flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure.

4. **Community Cloud:** Shared by several organizations with common concerns, such as compliance requirements or industry-specific regulations.
