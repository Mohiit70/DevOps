# DevOps 

DevOps is a culture and process aimed at improving the development and deployment of applications. It involves practices such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), automation, quality assurance, continuous monitoring, and continuous testing.

For example, the transition from PUBG version 1 to version 2 in just 10 days demonstrates effective DevOps practices. By prioritizing automation, quality control, and monitoring, teams can ensure faster and more reliable application delivery.

# Why Devops ?

Before 10 years ago, the typical software development and deployment process followed a linear path:

1. Developers wrote the code.
2. The code was sent to a central location.
3. System administrators managed the deployment of the code to servers.
4. The code was deployed to the application servers.
5. Testers tested the deployed application.
6. Build and Release Engineers (BRE) were responsible for deploying the application to the servers.

System administrators provisioned and managed the servers using technologies like OpenStack or VMware, while build and release engineers handled the deployment of the application.

This process involved multiple handoffs between different teams and manual steps, leading to longer delivery times and increased potential for errors. The advent of DevOps aimed to address these challenges by promoting automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery practices to streamline the software development and deployment lifecycle.
